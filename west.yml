# You are free to create your own manifest files and put them in any

# For example, you could create a manifest file in your own out of
# tree application directory, which would pull this Zephyr repository
# in as an ordinary project.
#
# You can pass your manifest repositories to west init when creating a
# new Zephyr installation. See the west documentation for more
# information.
